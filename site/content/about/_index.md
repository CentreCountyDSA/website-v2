democratic_socialism_definition: >-
  Democratic socialists believe that both the economy and society should be run
  democraticallyâ€”to meet public needs, not to make profits for a few. To achieve
  a more just society, many structures of our government and economy must be
  radically transformed through greater economic and social democracy so that
  ordinary Americans can participate in the many decisions that affect our
  lives.
dsa_definition: >-
  The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) is the largest socialist
  organization in the United States. We believe that working people should run
  both the economy and society democratically to meet human needs, not to make
  profits for a few. We are a political and activist organization, not a party;
  through campus and community-based chapters, DSA members use a variety of
  tactics, from legislative to direct action, to fight for reforms that empower
  working people.
