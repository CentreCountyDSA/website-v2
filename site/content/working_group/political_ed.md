Political Education is a working group focused on educating the community and developing the politics of our members. We meet for reading groups led by members, and we also have developed a political education curriculum on Rust Belt Political History and Marxism.

Are you interested in leading a discussion or joining in learning about topics like racial justice, ecosocialism, and international solidarity? Contact us at centrecodsa@gmail.com to get involved!
