The Centre County DSA Outreach Working Group is dedicated to building capacity for our chapter, connecting with new members and plugging them in with efforts that match their interests, and disseminating information about the efforts and projects of our chapter.  Each month, we meet after the general chapter meeting to evaluate new and infrequent meeting attendees and schedule one-on-ones to learn about their organizing goals and how best to bring them into the efforts of Centre County DSA.  Other efforts include regular social media engagement and advertisement of working group and chapter meetings and endorsed events as well as management of digital tools such as Action Network, Spoke, and VAN.
