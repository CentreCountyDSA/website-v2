    heading: What is Democratic Socialism?
    text: "Democratic socialists believe that both the economy and society should be run democraticallyâ€”to meet public needs, not to make profits for a few. To achieve a more just society, many structures of our government and economy must be radically transformed through greater economic and social democracy so that ordinary Americans can participate in the many decisions that affect our lives."
