# Bylaws of the Centre County PA Local Chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America

## ARTICLE I. Name.

The name of the Local Chapter shall be the Centre County Local Chapter of Democratic  Socialists of America (DSA).​ DSA is a not-for-profit corporation.    

## ARTICLE II. Purpose.

The Centre County Local Chapter of Democratic Socialists of America seeks to facilitate the  transition to a truly democratic and socialist society, one  in which the means/resources of production are  democratically and socially controlled.    

DSA rejects an economic order based solely on private profit, alienated labor, gross inequalities  of wealth and power, discrimination based on race, gender or sexual orientation, and brutality and  violence in defense of the status quo.    

DSA envisions a humane social order based on popular control of resources, production, and  economic planning, equitable distribution, gender and racial equality, and non-oppressive relationships.    

Our conception of socialism is a profoundly democratic one.  It is rooted in the belief that human  beings should be free to develop to their fullest potential, that public policies should be determined not by  wealth but by popular participation, and that individual liberties should be carefully safeguarded.  It is  committed to a freedom of speech that does not recoil from dissent, to a freedom to organize independent  trade unions, women’s groups, political parties, and other formations -- recognizing these as essential  bulwarks against the dangers of an intrusive state.  It is committed to a freedom of religion that  acknowledges the rights of those for whom spiritual concerns are central.    

We are socialists because we are developing a concrete strategy for achieving that vision.  In the  present, we are building a visible socialist presence within the broad democratic Left.  In the long run, we  hope to build a majority movement capable of making democratic socialism a reality in the United States.  Our strategy acknowledges the class structure of the U.S. society.  This class structure means that there is  a basic conflict of interest between those sectors with enormous economic power and the vast majority of  the population.

## ARTICLE III.	 Membership.

### Section 1.  Membership.

Members of the Centre County Local Chapter of DSA will be those individuals whose dues to national DSA are paid in full and who reside and/or work within the Local Chapter’s jurisdiction. Individuals may not be members of the Local Chapter without being members of national DSA. It will be the responsibility of members to approve policies and guidelines for the operation of the Local Chapter, to elect delegates to the national convention, to vote on matters related to national policy, and to make recommendations on issues and other matters to the National Political Committee of DSA.  

### Section 2.  Removal of Members.

1. Members may be recommended for expulsion or suspension from the Chapter by five votes of the Steering Committee provided they are found to be in substantial disagreement with the principles or policies of the organization; they consistently engage in undemocratic, disruptive behavior; or they publicly misrepresent the formal endorsements or positions adopted by vote of the Chapter membership. The recommended disciplinary action must be ratified at a Special Meeting with at least 15 calendar days’ notice given to the membership, and at least 20 percent of membership present for quorum. Expulsion will be determined by a simple majority vote of the members present. Members facing expulsion must receive written notice of the charges against them and must be given the opportunity to speak before both the Steering Committee and the members at the Special Meeting prior to a vote.
2. Harassment covered under Resolution 33 of the 2017 Convention is exempt from the above process. The Local Chapter will designate a person on the Steering Committee that will act as an ombudsperson for complaints and will make public contact information for that ombudsperson. If the ombudsperson is party to a complaint, the matter will be immediately referred to the National Grievance Officer. Within seven days of receipt of a complaint pursuant to Resolution 33, the ombudsperson will notify the accused and request that they affirm or deny the allegations. If the allegations are not disputed, the matter will proceed directly to remedy. If the allegations are under dispute, the ombudsperson will confidentially investigate the matter and present a report to the Steering Committee recommending a course of action. The Steering Committee will determine whether the issue can be resolved at the local level, or whether it should be referred to the National Grievance Officer.

Remedy up to and including expulsion will be determined by majority vote of the Steering Committee based upon the request of the accuser, the severity of the offense, the response of the accused, and the recommendation of the ombudsperson. Where possible, investigation and remedy will be conducted according to the principle of restorative justice. All parties have the right to appeal the form of relief determined by the Steering Committee within 30 calendar days. If they are not satisfied with the Steering Committee’s final disposition, they have the right to appeal the form of relief to the National Grievance Officer. Determinations made by the national organization are final and cannot be appealed.

Abuse or contravention of the grievance procedure is expressly prohibited. Nothing within the grievance procedure will be construed to deprive members of their legal rights.
