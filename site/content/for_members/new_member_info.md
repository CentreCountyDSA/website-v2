## **New Member Info**

Are you a new DSA member? Are you interested in socialist organizing and not sure where to start? You're in the right place!



****

**Learn about our priorities as a chapter**

Our chapter has five priorities: Socialist Feminism, Supporting Working People, Building Socialist Consciousness, Community Defense and Mutual Aid, and EcoSocialism.

We reassess our priorities every April at our DSA Centre County Convention. 



****

**Join one of our working groups**

Our working groups focus on particular aspects of our priorities by building campaigns and providing education to the rest of the chapter. Working groups are where the work gets done. 

We currently have working groups for: Labor, Electoral, Political Education, Mutual Aid, Recruitment/Outreach, YDSA/Youth Organizing, Socialist Feminism (a discussion group), and an ad hoc working group for racial justice organizing. Ask who is the point person for the working group and then let them know you want to get involved!

_You do not need to be a DSA member to join a working group._

****

**Come to an event this month**

At the general meeting we will announce the major events for the month, which will include working group meetings, political education events, social gatherings, mutual aid events, and endorsed and DSA-run direct actions around a particular issue or campaign!

We will send out updates through our main email list if there are changes to any of these events. If you came to this meeting we will make sure to put you on that email list serve! At the bottom of our weekly emails you will find a link to our  Centre County DSA Google calendar.

**Become an official DSA member by paying your national dues**

If you’d like to officially join us, go to https://act.dsausa.org/donate/membership/ to pay your national dues. We encourage you to sign up for monthly dues, as our chapter will receive a share of these monthly dues for our local activities. 

There are a variety of dues levels, and you are encouraged to pay what you can afford, but nobody will be turned away due to inability to pay. 

Dues pay for national events, the salaries of DSA’s staff and organizers and national programming.

Becoming a DSA member makes you eligible to run for office in our chapter, vote on chapter business during regular meetings, and will also let you join the Discourse, DSA’s online discussion board.

**Support our chapter by signing up for local dues**

You can make a voluntary additional contribution directly to our chapter by signing up at **https://www.patreon.com/centrecodsa**

This is a monthly contribution which supports the expenses of our chapter like purchasing supplies for events and rallies, paying the deposit for our monthly meetings, and funding our campaigns.

You are encouraged to pay what you can afford, but you can donate at any level and donations are not mandatory.

Local dues do not confer any additional privileges.
